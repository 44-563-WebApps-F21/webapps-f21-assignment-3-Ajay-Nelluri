<h1>HULK</h1>
<P>The Hulk is a fictional character and superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics.
    The Hulk's strength is probably the greatest in the Marvel universe, with many foes falling to his thunderous attacks.
     The Hulk is also able to leap great distances traveling for miles before bounding upwards again. For his size,
      the Hulk is incredibly fast and can run great distances at extreme speeds. The Hulk's strength remains at the top level of 
      all super human beings on Earth and increases exponentially as his anger grows. This strength grants him not only upper body 
      prowess, but also the ability to leap great distances and land without harm to himself.
